						<p>The field of Psychophysics, the raddest name for a science btw, has this concept of just noticeable difference.</p>
						<p>Any human observable phenomena needs to have a certain level of difference in order for that difference to be noticieable.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Steve Seow of microsoft found that the JND threshold for time is about 20%.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>One of my favorite ways to do that is replacing click events with mousedown (and touchstart) events.</p>
						<p>Click events actually fire not when the mouse button goes down, but when it comes back up again.</p>
						<p>So there's this gap when the user has clicked down, but the click event has yet to fire.</p>
						<p>We can load things when the mouse button goes down, and only display them when the click event fires as the user releases their mouse button.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Active states function just like hoverstates, but they fire when an element is clicked.</p>
						<p>They give your app a sense of immediacy and responsiveness which helps to keep the user's thought flow uninterrupted.</p>
						<p>If you set the active animation duration to 150-200ms, people will keep their mouse button pressed for the full duration of the animation; so instead of holding their mouse button down for 100-150ms, they hold it down for 150-200ms. You end up coaxing them into giving us a longer head start from our mousedown event.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Chris Harrison, a grad student at Carnegie Mellon found that progress bars with bands that animate in the opposite direction of the progress make the bar seem to fill faster.</p>
						<p>Same principle of being on a train, and another train is coming by the opposite direction, you look out the window to see the other train whizzing by, and it seems like you're going twice as fast.</p>
						<p>In a followup study he found that if those bands accellerate, the bar feels faster still. Can get that accelerating feel just by applying an ease-in to the animation.</p>

This demo will load the second step of the form after the user has inputted text into all the form fields.  Note that we wouldn't be sending their data to the server when they fill input fields, we'll still wait for a click to do that (don't want to transmit data that is then revised).  BUT in the real world we'd still use this as an opportunity to load the assets necessary to render the next step in the form.</p>

We predict that if a user hovers the button, they will click the button.  Moreover, if they hover over a hitbox outside the button, we predict they will continue to move their mouse onto the button and click it.  You can reveal the hitbox by clicking the checkbox within the demo.</p>
