TODOS:

Need to remove minimum viable layout thing from unsuck passive waiting time section?  Rendering minimum viable layout seems more like an objective performance thing; I'm also hurting for time soooooo.....?

In the react immediately section, the transition between 100ms stuff and 1000ms stuff (click event shit) needs to be smoothed over.

Is the animation/jank/100ms immediate shit off topic?

Structure 5/31:
* Intro
* why percieved perf matters
* How humans sense time (active vs passive)
* How to keep users active
	- don't show loaders
	- immediate response (removed animation)
	- respond quickly with mousedown/touchstart
	- use interstitial anims
* How to make passive waits seem to pass more quickly
	- Good loader animations (progress bars)
	- How to make a good fake progress bar
	- [[Hide long loading time with extraneous stuff]]
* Predictive design (short circuiting this process)
	- Houston story: consultants predicted that after getting off the plane, people go to pick up their bags, and loaded their 
	- We can predict user behavior too, you've probably done it before
	- 


Laura notes 6/4
* ✅50ms (active animation bonus) isn't perceived? But it can make a difference when added to the total time
* ✅change "give users certainty" to match the intro list heading
* ✅change don't overdo it slide
* ✅include mech turk study for explained progress bars
* fake progress bars real world examples (twitter)
* your talky on the fake progress bar slide blows
* ✅styling of code block.
* Is code block really the best way to present this information??
* admit that going from a slow connection to a faster connection can fuck things up
* ✅maybe don't inclue mass effect because people hate it
* find a silly game example
* ✅remove uber loading screen
* remove word "snowflake"
* make predictive form more like a chekcot flow
* ✅unfuck your 3d example
* demo of shitty wifi infinite scroll
* unfuck conclusion
