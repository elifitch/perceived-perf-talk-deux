TODOS:

Need to remove minimum viable layout thing from unsuck passive waiting time section?  Rendering minimum viable layout seems more like an objective performance thing; I'm also hurting for time soooooo.....?

In the react immediately section, the transition between 100ms stuff and 1000ms stuff (click event shit) needs to be smoothed over.

Is the animation/jank/100ms immediate shit off topic?
