TODOS:

Need to remove minimum viable layout thing from unsuck passive waiting time section?  Rendering minimum viable layout seems more like an objective performance thing; I'm also hurting for time soooooo.....?

In the react immediately section, the transition between 100ms stuff and 1000ms stuff (click event shit) needs to be smoothed over.

Is the animation/jank/100ms immediate shit off topic?

Structure 5/31:
* Intro
* why percieved perf matters
* How humans sense time (active vs passive)
* How to keep users active
	- immediate response
	- mousedown/touchstart
	- don't show loaders
	- use interstitial anims
* How to make passive waits seem to pass more quickly
	- Good loader animations (progress bars)
	- How to make a good fake progress bar
	- [[Hide long loading time with extraneous stuff]]
* Predictive design (short circuiting this process)
